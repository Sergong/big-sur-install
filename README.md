# big-sur-install
This playbook is for the installation of Mac Applications for the Apple Store on macOS 11.x

# Important Note
This uses the mas client (which needs to be installed using homebrew). Unfortunately the MAS client module does not have a way to 'purchase' apps that have never been installed on your Mac before. Therefore not terribly useful on clean Mac installs.
